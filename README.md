# Signal_Image_ComputerVision_projects

This individual projects were carried out for the courses of Data capture and processing, Image processing (Pattern Recognition) and Computer Vision II of the Master's degree in Biometrics and Intelligent vision at Université Paris-est Cretéil during my Exchange semester. They were made during the first semester of the academic year 2024-2025 (September 2024 - January 2025).

## PURPOSE

The aim of these projects was to learn signal processing, image processing and computer vision techniques, also with a focus on the usage of them in the medical sector. The programming language used is Python.
